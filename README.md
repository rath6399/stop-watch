The program worked extremely well for two components of the program.

For the tea selection program it worked flawlessly as it should have done. The only recommendation I have for that portion of the program is to simply add words on the buttons that can actually be seen once the the tea selection has been made, I had no way of knowing without some trial and error. My recommendation for this is to make the buttons larger than they currently are and perhaps shorten the titles to something such as reselect and exit

The second aspect that worked correctly, as far as I could tell, was the camera function from the book.  The start camera button could be a little longer as some of the wording is cut off on the bottom. But other than that there appeared to be no issues while looking through the code and seeing the program run.

The third component was the map code from the book, and I could not get it to work, even with going into the xml code and trying to enable everything for the google api, so if this did work for you congratulations and you are a smarter being than I.

Overall I was impressed by how well the program worked as a whole, the only thing that was particularly troublesome was the map function and the general theme, the colors used was not easy from this users perspective, it made things very difficult to read and started giving me a touch of a headache. Otherwise the buttons for controlling things were working well and navigation was mostly a cinch.
